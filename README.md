1️⃣ Set Up an S3 Bucket: I began by creating an S3 bucket to securely store the dataset. S3's durability and scalability ensured a seamless data storage solution.

2️⃣ Uploaded the Large Dataset: With the S3 bucket in place, I uploaded the extensive dataset of best-selling Amazon products. S3's user-friendly interface made this process a breeze.

3️⃣ Connecting S3 and QuickSight: The magic happened when I established a connection between S3 and QuickSight. This allowed QuickSight to directly access and analyze the data stored in S3.
